# MassSpecBlocks
MassSpecBlocks is open source, web application to manage own user databases of chemical structures like NRPs and to find structures on other chemical projects like [Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), [ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com), [Norine](https://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/) and [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/downloadsForward.do).

# Application info
Application have separated frontend and backend. **Frontend** is developed in React with typesript and have own **[frontend repo](https://github.com/privrja/thesis-frontend-react)**. **Backend** is written in PHP with Symfony framework, **[backend repo](https://github.com/privrja/thesis)**. Application is developed for Mysql 8 /MariaDB 10, but when using symfony you can create your own migrations for other database. Application uses many other libraries like [SmilesDrawer](https://github.com/privrja/smilesDrawer) from Daniel Probst to draw chemical structures from SMILES frromat or JSME from Peter Ertl and Bruno Bienfait to editing chemical structures. Application is based on previuous application [Bbdgnc](https://github.com/privrja/bbdgnc). Application was devoloped within the diploma thesis MassSpecBlocks: MassSpecBlocks: Database of Sequences and Building Blocks of Microbial Metabolites for Mass Spectra Analysis, Jan Přívratský, FIT CTU Prague, 2021.
