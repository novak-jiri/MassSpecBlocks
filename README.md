# MassSpecBlocks
MassSpecBlocks: Database of Sequences and Building Blocks of Microbial Metabolites for Mass Spectra Analysis is open source, web application to manage own user databases of chemical structures like NRPs and to find structures on other chemical projects like [Pubchem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), [ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com), [Norine](https://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/) and [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/downloadsForward.do). Application provides export format to for open source program [Cyclobranch](https://ms.biomed.cas.cz/cyclobranch/docs/html/) from Jiří Novák (Laboratory of Molecular Structure Characterization - Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic).

# Application info
Application have separated frontend and backend. **Frontend** is developed in React with typesript and have own [frontend repo](https://github.com/privrja/thesis-frontend-react). **Backend** is written in PHP with Symfony framework, [backend repo](https://github.com/privrja/thesis). Application is developed for Mysql 8 /MariaDB 10, but when using symfony you can create your own migrations for other database. Application uses many other libraries like [SmilesDrawer](https://github.com/privrja/smilesDrawer) from **Daniel Probst** to draw chemical structures from SMILES frromat or [JSME](https://jsme-editor.github.io) from **Peter Ertl and Bruno Bienfait** to editing chemical structures. Application is based on previuous application [Bbdgnc](https://github.com/privrja/bbdgnc). Application was devoloped within the diploma thesis MassSpecBlocks: **MassSpecBlocks: Database of Sequences and Building Blocks of Microbial Metabolites for Mass Spectra Analysis**, Jan Přívratský, FIT CTU Prague, 2021. Supervisor **Jiří Novák**
