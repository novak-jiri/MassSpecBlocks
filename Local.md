# How to run local dev

# Backend

First of all you need running Mysql/MariaDB database, where application can store its data.
Other prerequizities is to have installed [PHP](https://www.php.net) >= 7.2.5, [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and [symfony cli](https://symfony.com/download). I recommend setting all available on consoled line 


When this criteria is met you can clone backend project from GitHub.

`git clone https://github.com/privrja/thesis.git`
`cd thesis`

Then you can install dependencies throught composer.

`composer install`

To start dev server use symfony cli.
